# HackHer413 2020 Tech Team Challenge

I began by going into the provided index.html file and editing the example writing. For example, I altered the interests tab and inserted my own personal interests. I also went about removing things that weren't applicable to me such as the small logos under skills referencing languages that I do not know. 

Next, I altered the image by replacing it with a png of myself.

Then, I began adding logos linking to things like my spotify. I also altered the links for the provided icons such as facebook and github. 

Finally, I altered the coloring of the navbar as well as some text and hyperlinks. I also implemented some creative and helpful elements such as icons  and links to websites that displayed my awards. 

I primarily stuck to html and css in altering the template. I utilized https://www.w3schools.com/ for anything that I could not remember or needed to add.
